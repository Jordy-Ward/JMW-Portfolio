#JMW.Industries

This project is a web application to highlight myself as an aspiring dev. It consists of a backend API built with Java and Spring Boot, and a frontend application built with React.


## Still in the early stages

Started as a pure RSA encryption web based messaging app, it has grown into more of a public cv initiative and is in the process of being a highlight of my past and present projects.
